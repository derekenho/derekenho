# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Derek Duarte and I'm a 22-year-old back-end developer specializing in Python, with a strong focus on machine learning and AI-related projects. I'm passionate about leveraging data and AI to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions.

I've been diving into JavaScript for the past 4 months to expand my skill set and help me in future projects. I believe in lifelong learning and am always eager to explore new technologies and concepts.

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing Valorant, Counter-Strike 2 or watching videos and reading.

Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate on a project, need help with something, or just want to chat!
